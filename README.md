# Actuarial Data Science Portfolio
## Davide Rindori - Actuary & Data Scientist

Welcome to my professional portfolio. This repository showcases a collection of projects where actuarial science meets modern data engineering and machine learning, with a specific focus on risk modeling and climate-related NatCat analysis.

## 📂 Project Index

### 1. [Motor Pricing & Interpretability](./01_Motor_Pricing_Interpretability)
**Focus:** *Machine Learning, Insurance Pricing, XAI (Explainable AI)*
* Developed a frequency-severity pricing framework for a motor portfolio.
* Implemented Gradient Boosting models (XGBoost/LightGBM) and compared them with traditional GLMs.
* Used **SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)** to ensure model interpretability, bridging the gap between "Black Box" models and actuarial transparency.

### 2. [Zurich Extreme Precipitation Analysis (EVT)](./02_Climate_Risk_EVT)
**Focus:** *Climate Risk, Extreme Value Theory, Big Data Engineering*
* Modeled "Tail Risk" for catastrophic flooding events in Zurich using 44 years of ERA5 climate data.
* Engineered a pipeline to process ~385,000 hourly observations, identifying a **43% underestimation** in risk when using low-resolution data.
* Fitted **Gumbel distributions** to estimate 100-year return levels, providing key inputs for Solvency and PML (Probable Maximum Loss) assessments.
